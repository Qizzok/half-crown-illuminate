                <div>This is a cooperative web game for two people, played locally in turns. It requires Javascript and a mouse, keyboard, or touch input to play.</div>
                <div>The game is played on an expanded (8 wide by 10 high) chessboard with one player controlling white pieces and the other player controlling black pieces. The pieces are arranged and move by the rules of chess. Both players have fog of war obscuring the entire board except for spaces containing their own pieces and spaces their teammate's pieces could move to.</div>
                <div>The objective of the game is mutual survival. Neutral pieces will spawn in empty spaces, appearing as blue and invisible to your teammate until revealed. You cannot capture them or be captured by them, but your teammate can. Neutral pieces your opponent reveals that you may capture and be captured by appear in red.</div>
                <div>A move along an obscured path will be interrupted by unseen pieces, stopping without capturing, but you can capture an unseen piece by moving onto its space. You can also take your teammate's pieces but this offers no advantage. A 3-turn move history is shown in light red while the spaces are visible, even if they were not when the move was made.</div>
                <div>Consider choices carefully. Identify targets for your teammate and defend your pieces from the threats they reveal. The game ends when either king is captured.</div>
